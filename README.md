##  6. Limitations & Future Work

- Dataset covers only *six months* — a longer time frame would improve trend reliability.  
- Only **sales revenue** analyzed — no cost or profitability data included.  
- Lacks **customer segmentation** (new vs. returning customers).  
- Future work could include:  
  - Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis  
  - Product profitability breakdown  
  - Loyalty and retention metrics

- **Morning sales dominate** revenue — strong customer habit.  
- **Afternoon hours** and **weekends** represent clear improvement opportunities.  
- Focused campaigns and menu diversification could increase total revenue by **10–20%** in the short term.
